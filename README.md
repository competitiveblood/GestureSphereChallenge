# GestureSphereChallenge
The Python script uses mediapipe and OpenCV for a hand-tracking game. Players catch moving balls with hand gestures, scoring points by aligning their index finger with the balls. The game loop continuously tracks hand movements, updating the score and displaying the video feed until the user exits with 'q'.
