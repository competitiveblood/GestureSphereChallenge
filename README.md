# GestureSphereChallenge

The Python script leverages mediapipe and OpenCV to implement a hand-tracking game. The game loop continuously captures video frames, tracks hand landmarks using mediapipe, and displays the current score. A dynamically moving target represents the ball, and the player scores points by aligning their hand's index finger tip with the ball's position. If successful, the target's position updates randomly, and the score increments. The game loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
